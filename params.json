Coughed a cricket  \r\nwho’d seen all that Lucy had.  \r\nHow is it that you are so happy?  \r\nOn the dance floor, you were kinda bad.  \r\n\r\nLucy was not offended  \r\nShe knew the cricket was not wrong.  \r\nGood and bad are relative  \r\nIf we are singing the same song.  \r\n\r\nAnd so that is why I am happy  \r\nI choose to dance just for me  \r\nI determine what is good and bad  \r\nAnd pay no attention to what others see  \r\n\r\nWith that, the cricket smiled  \r\nand picked up his flute.  \r\nTruthfully, I could never play it  \r\nI just thought that it looked cute  \r\n\r\nSo he started blowing  \r\nHe hit a note here and there.  \r\nHe understood what Lucy meant  \r\nAnd made music without a care.  \r\n\r\nThen each animal from the dance  \r\napproached with a look of dread.  \r\nTheir eyes were on the ground  \r\nThey must have heard what Lucy said.  \r\n\r\nThe lion whispered, I love math  \r\nBut I’m afraid how it makes me look,  \r\nAnd a baboon confessed,  \r\nMy dream is to write a book.  \r\n\r\nBut that was not all  \r\nThe best was saved for last.  \r\nTwo chimps screamed I LOVE YOU!  \r\nAnd embraced without being asked.  \r\n\r\nLucy raised her head  \r\nand looked up at the moon and stars above.  \r\nWhat a mess we’ve created,  \r\nBut at least we’ll do what we love.\r\n\r\n---\r\nBuy the original “Giraffes Can’t Dance” on [Amazon](http://amzn.to/1Lv9uLX)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

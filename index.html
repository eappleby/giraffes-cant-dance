<p>Lucy was a tall giraffe<br>
Whose neck was long and slim,<br>
But her knees were awfully crooked<br>
And her legs were rather thin.  </p>

<p>She was very good at standing still<br>
And munching shoots off trees,<br>
But when she tried to run around<br>
She buckled at the knees.  </p>

<p>Now every year in Africa<br>
They hold a Jungle Dance,<br>
Where every single animal<br>
Turns up to skip and prance.  </p>

<p>This year when the day arrived<br>
Lucy put on her dancing shoes.<br>
Even though she had never danced before<br>
She knew there was nothing to lose.  </p>

<p>The warthogs started waltzing<br>
And the rhinos rock ‘n’ rolled.<br>
The lions danced a tango<br>
Which was elegant and bold.  </p>

<p>The chimps all did a cha-cha<br>
With a very Latin feel,<br>
And eight baboons then teamed up<br>
For a splendid Scottish reel.  </p>

<p>Lucy looked focused<br>
As she approached the dance floor.<br>
She listened to her heartbeat<br>
Even as the lions roared.  </p>

<p>Hey, look at clumsy Lucy!<br>
The animals all sneered,<br>
But Lucy paid no attention<br>
And smiled from ear to ear.  </p>

<p>The laughter continued<br>
From everyone around.<br>
They thought they saw a circus,<br>
But it was they that were the clowns.  </p>

<p>When Lucy finished dancing<br>
She simply turned and headed home.<br>
Her confidence was brimming<br>
She could move a mountain all alone.  </p>

<p>She stopped at a little clearing<br>
and she looked over at the bend.<br>
The world can be so beautiful.<br>
I want this day to never end.  </p>

<p>Excuse me! Coughed a cricket<br>
who’d seen all that Lucy had.<br>
How is it that you are so happy?<br>
On the dance floor, you were kinda bad.  </p>

<p>Lucy was not offended<br>
She knew the cricket was not wrong.<br>
Good and bad are relative<br>
If we are singing the same song.  </p>

<p>And so that is why I am happy<br>
I choose to dance just for me<br>
I determine what is good and bad<br>
And pay no attention to what others see  </p>

<p>With that, the cricket smiled<br>
and picked up his flute.<br>
Truthfully, I could never play it<br>
I just thought that it looked cute  </p>

<p>So he started blowing<br>
He hit a note here and there.<br>
He understood what Lucy meant<br>
And made music without a care.  </p>

<p>Then each animal from the dance<br>
approached with a look of dread.<br>
Their eyes were on the ground<br>
They must have heard what Lucy said.  </p>

<p>The lion whispered, I love math<br>
But I’m afraid how it makes me look,<br>
And a baboon confessed,<br>
My dream is to write a book.  </p>

<p>But that was not all<br>
The best was saved for last.<br>
Two chimps screamed I LOVE YOU!<br>
And embraced without being asked.  </p>

<p>Lucy raised her head<br>
and looked up at the moon and stars above.<br>
What a mess we’ve created,<br>
But at least we’ll do what we love.</p>
